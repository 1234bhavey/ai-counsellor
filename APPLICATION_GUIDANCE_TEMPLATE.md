const calculateTimeline = (applicationDeadline, currentDate) => {
  const weeksAvailable = Math.floor((applicationDeadline - currentDate) / (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  
  if (weeksAvailable >= 12) {
    return 'comfortable'; // Full 12-week timeline
  } else if (weeksAvailable >= 8) {
    return 'moderate'; // Compressed 8-week timeline
  } else if (weeksAvailable >= 4) {
    return 'urgent'; // Rush 4-week timeline
  } else {
    return 'critical'; // Emergency timeline
  }
};
```

### Profile-Based Adjustments
```javascript
const adjustTimelineForProfile = (baseTimeline, profile) => {
  let adjustments = [];
  
  if (profile.ielts_status === 'not-started') {
    adjustments.push('Add 6-8 weeks for IELTS preparation and test');
  }
  
  if (profile.gre_status === 'not-started') {
    adjustments.push('Add 8-12 weeks for GRE preparation and test');
  }
  
  if (profile.academic_background === 'international') {
    adjustments.push('Add 2-4 weeks for credential evaluation');
